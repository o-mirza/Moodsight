The agent was friendly but my issue took too long to resolve.
I was disconnected halfway through my call and had to start over.
The representative was very knowledgeable and solved my problem quickly.
I felt rushed and not fully listened to during my call.
The wait time was much shorter than I expected. Great service!
I'm not satisfied with the solution provided; it didn't address my needs.
The instructions given were clear and easy to follow.
